# __COIL Website Backup__

This is a Duplicator plugin backup file of the new COIL Charter School official website, deployed in 2024.

You can find the current live website [here](https://coilk12.net/).

This website was developed from October 2022 to September 2024 as a volunteer project for more than 200 hours.

The platform is built on WordPress, based on the Twenty Twenty-Three theme. The webpage layout and design were first created as mockups in Photoshop, and then implemented as custom pages in WordPress.

Further features are implemented through custom css code as well as WordPress community plugins including Duplicator, Sticky Menu, Otter Blocks and Simple Calendar.

Other steps in the project's development include creating custom logos, revising the sitemap structure, and deploying and maintaining the final product on GoDaddy.

This project was engineered using an iterative approach, seeking and implementing school staff feedback at every step to maximize user convenience and navigational clarity.

I am very grateful for the opportunity to put my IT and engineering skills towards improving my school's community with such an influential project.
